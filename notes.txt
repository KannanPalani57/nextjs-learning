With fonts, layout shift happens when the browser initially 
renders text in a fallback or system font and then swaps it out for a
custom font once it has loaded. This swap can cause the text size, 
spacing, or layout to change, shifting elements around it.


Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the application when you use the
next/font module. It downloads font files at build time and hosts them 
with your other static assets. This means when a user visits your application, 
there are no additional network requests for fonts which would impact performance.


Images without dimensions and web fonts are common causes of 
layout shift due to the browser having to download additional resources.
